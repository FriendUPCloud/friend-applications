# friend-applications
A collection of applications for Friend |Â The Internet OS


Some of these applications are native FriendUP applications while others are simple iframe web apps. Essentially they allow remotes websites to be interacted with inside a Friend window.

For <b>SOME</b> of those iframe web apps there are some current limitations. Due to certain web sites preventing iframe access, some of these applications require the use of a Chrome extension called [Ignore X-Frame headers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ignore-x-frame-headers/gleekbfjekiniecknbkamfmkohkpodhe).

There are security risks associated with this extension as it bypasses the x-frame restrictions for all or specific web domains. Please reasearch these risks and decide for yourself <b>BEFORE</b> installing this extension.

Due to the nature of the how these web apps are made, some features of a particular web site may function differently or not at all. In the Help section for the app, please check for known limitations. 

Enjoy!
